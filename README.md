# VHDL Codes & Simulations
This page contains VHDL Codes of different projects for understanding concepts of VHDL.
The projects are done on Quartus II 13.0 sp1 (64 bit) software and Altera de2 board Cyclone II.

Project 1. This project consists of basic gates like AND, OR, NOT and XOR.

Project 2. It is 4:1 multiplexer designed using with-select statement. This could also be done using when-else statement.

Project 3. It is 3 bit D Flip-Flop which also acts as a counter. It counts from 000 to 111. The count can be varied by changing the number of bits of Q and D i.e. std_logic_vector
