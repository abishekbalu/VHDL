# VHDL Codes & Simulations
This page contains VHDL Codes of different projects for understanding concepts of VHDL.
The projects are done on Quartus II 13.0 sp1 (64 bit) software and Altera de2 board Cyclone II. Most of the simulations are done on Modelsim Altera. So, make sure to make these changes in the Quartus software setting where you have to provide the location of the simulator.

# Project 1. Basic Gates
  This project consists of basic gates like AND, OR, NOT and XOR.

# Project 2. Concurrent Statement (Multiplexer)
  It is 4:1 multiplexer designed using with-select statement. This could also be done using when-else statement.

# Project 3. D Flip-Flop Counter
  It is 3 bit D Flip-Flop which also acts as a counter. It counts from 000 to 111. The count can be varied by changing the number of bits of Q and D i.e. std_logic_vector. This project uses sequential statement and event attributes.

# Project 4. Noise Generator
  This is a noise generator whose output is of 16 bits. The bits 15, 14, 12 and 3 are XOR together to bit 0. For observing the output in the Modelsim simulator, change the radix of the output to analog.
